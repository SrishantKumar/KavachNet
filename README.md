# कवचNet - Caesar Cipher Decryption Android App

कवचNet is an Android app designed to decrypt messages encoded with the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique. This app is perfect for students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and anyone interested in cryptography, as it allows users to decrypt messages without needing to know the specific shift value.

## Features

- **Automatic Decryption**: Enter an encrypted message, and the app automatically tries all possible shifts to find the most readable output.
- **Custom Shift Option**: For users who know the shift value, a custom option is available for more targeted decryption.
- **Insights and Analysis**: The app highlights likely readable text based on common words, making it easier to spot meaningful decrypted messages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive design makes it easy to input and view decrypted text.
- **No Data Collection**: कवचNet does not collect or store any personal data, ensuring complete user privacy.
